# MKS Data Catalogue

The MKS Data Catalogue is a plugin for the Wordpress content management system which enhance it with data cataloguing capabilities, similar to popular data catalogue, registry or repository platforms. It creates a new type of posts for datasets and another one the licences (redistribution policies) associated with the datasets. It also include page templates for searching and browsing the data, as well as creating forms to register new basic datasets. 

Amongst the advantages of the MKS Data Catalogue component is the very easy deployment (as long as you have a Wordpress platform installed, which is very straighforward), as well as the ease of customisation and extension (by modifying the stylesheets and templates available, or creating wordpress plugins interacting with the catalogue).


## Compatibility with CKAN API

This is currently being developped and will be made available soon.
