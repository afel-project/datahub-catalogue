# MKS Data Catalogue

The MKS Data Catalogue component is a plugin for the Wordpress content management system which enhance it with data cataloguing capabilities, similar to popular data catalogue, registry or repository platforms. It creates a new type of posts for datasets and another one the licences (redistribution policies) associated with the datasets. It also include page templates for searching and browsing the data, as well as creating forms to register new basic datasets. 

Amongst the advantages of the MKS Data Catalogue component is the very easy deployment (as long as you have a Wordpress platform installed, which is very straighforward), as well as the ease of customisation and extension (by modifying the stylesheets and templates available, or creating wordpress plugins interacting with the catalogue).

## Installation 

You should have Wordpress running and configure before installing the MKS Data Cataloguing component. Once that's done, download or clone this repository and copy the "mks-data-cataloguing" repository in the "wp-content/plugin/" folder of your wordpress installation. The plugin wil then appear in the plugin area of the Wordpress admin interface, and you should be able to activate it.
